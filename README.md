Hi my name is John Mannion and i'am a thrid year student in GMIT studying software development. As part of a new module called 
data representation and query our class was given the oppourtunity to learn a new programming language called [GO](https://golang.org/)  .
This is a new programming language that has been developed by google and was officially released as Go version 1.0 in March 2012. 

This repository contains a number of go problem solutions. The go problems vary from a simple hello world program to a more complicated 
problem such as newton's method for square roots. The work sheet can be found [here](https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-fundamentals.html)  .

Running the code

To run the code in this repository, the files must first be compiled. The Go [compiler](https://golang.org/doc/install) must first be installed on your machine. 
Once that is installed, the code can be compiled and run by following these steps. We assume you are using the command line.

Clone this repository using Git.
> git clone https://github.com/data-representation/go-examples  (url of git repository)
Change into the folder.
> cd go-examples
Compile the first file with the following command.
> go build 01-hello-world.go 
(this will produce an executable file)
Run the executable produced.
> ./01-hello-world.exe
Hello, world!
Repeat steps 3 and 4 above, replacing the filenames as appropriate.
> go compile <filename.go>
> ./<filename.exe>
